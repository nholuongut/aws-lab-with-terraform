## How to deploy the terraform code
1. Navigate to the folder: E,g: `cd aws-3-tier-web`
3. Init the terraform: `terraform init`
4. Apply the deployment: `terraform apply`. Then type `yes` to approve
5. Explore the app your way!
6. Once we don't want to use lab anymore (and to avoid some unexpected billing), destroy it by running: `terraform destroy`. Then type `yes` to approve
